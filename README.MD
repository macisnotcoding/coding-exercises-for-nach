# Programming Solutions for Nach

## Introduction

Welcome to our programming solutions repository, crafted with the purpose of supporting my friend Nach in his journey through learning programming. This initiative stems from the desire to provide a structured and accessible collection of programming solutions, focusing primarily on console applications using C#. Whether you're Nach or someone else with a keen interest in programming, you're welcome to explore, learn, and contribute.

## Repository Purpose

This repository serves as a dynamic resource where I'll be documenting solutions to various programming problems encountered along the way, particularly those we tackle from [Retos de Programaci√≥n](https://retosdeprogramacion.com/ejercicios/). Our mainstay programming language is C#, chosen for its robustness and versatility in solving a wide range of problems.

## What to Expect

- **Problem Descriptions**: Each solved problem will include a detailed description to offer context and understanding of the challenge at hand.
- **Solutions in C#**: Solutions will be provided with C# code snippets, accompanied by an explanation of the logic and approach taken.
- **Focus on Console Applications**: Given our current focus, the solutions will predominantly revolve around console applications, showcasing the practical use of C# in solving real-world problems.
- **Interactive Menu to Test Solutions**: An interactive menu has been implemented to easily test and demonstrate the solutions for each programming challenge.
- **Template for Implementing New Exercises**: A standardized template is available to facilitate the addition of new exercises, ensuring consistency and ease of integration.
- **Learning Resources and References**: Where applicable, links to useful resources, documentation, and guides will be shared to enhance the learning experience.

## How to Use This Repository

- **Browsing and Learning**: Feel free to explore the solutions, understand the logic behind them, and apply the learning to similar problems you encounter.
- **Testing Solutions**: Utilize the interactive menu to execute and test solutions, providing a hands-on experience with the code.
- **Implementing New Exercises**: Use the [provided template](https://github.com/macisnotcoding/coding-exercises-for-nach/blob/master/RetosMoureDev/Ejercicios/Templates/EjercicioTemplate.cs) with the appropiate naming (`Ejercicio0xxx`) when adding new exercises to maintain the structure and quality of the repository.
- **Search Functionality**: Use the search feature to find solutions to specific challenges or topics of interest.
- **Feedback and Contributions**: We welcome feedback on the solutions provided and encourage contributions from anyone willing to share their approach to solving programming challenges.
